Interpreters have been an important factor for bridging the communication gaps be it between individuals, companies, politicians, etc. It is the same in the case of speaking majority and the minority group that have speaking and hearing impairment.  In 2016, Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act (RPwD) demanded that the ISL gets recognized and insisted that the Government and public sectors hire interpreters to create an environment suitable for people with disability. But a manual translator is not always the best solution. Indian Sign Language Research and Training Centre (ISLRTC) developed a dictionary with the help of the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (DEPwD). Edition one had about 3000 words and was launched in March 2018. The 2nd edition has ~6000 words including categories like medical, legal, academic, technical, etc.  (Verma, et al., 2015), in their paper stated that the 2011 census suggested that 2% to 8% of the population in India has disabilities. That being said, ~1 million adults and ~0.5 million children use ISL for communicating although it has not been recognized as an official language that people with hearing impairment could use. India being a diverse country with many languages, standardizing ISL can be a cumbersome task. Like any language with different dialects, sign language may vary from state to state. For instance, in the western part of India, different sign languages are spoken in Mumbai and Pune which lie 80 Km away from each other. Languages have their grammar and syntax and they are not the same as ISL. Since there is no standardized format, it is difficult to determine the hand gestures unlike in the case of ASL or BSL. Also, ISL was recognized as a language very recently as mentioned in section 1.  The Indian Sign Language Research and Training Centre (ISLRTC) have created around 3000 Hindi and English and this is constantly being updated to remove ambiguity and redundancy (Rewari, et al., 2018).  ISL can also be single handed as well as double handed (Dutta, et al., 2015). Thus, having such vast combinations of a language could be very difficult for any individual to learn thus, limiting the communication between both groups of people. This can definitely hinder the chances of the deaf and mute community to find jobs in the real world. Many researches have been done on ASL as the language is standardized. ISL seems to be more complex due to the immense amount of word and alphabet combinations that are available (Nair & Bindu V, 2013). Also, the ISL is not being officially used in schools, workplaces, universities etc. to be used to communicate with the vocally impaired community.  Deep learning can help use static images and recognize these alphabet signs. 

# Aim of the Study

The aim of the paper is to build a deep learning model that would assist in predicting and classifying “Double Handed ISL English Alphabets” so as to aid teachers, ISLRTC, schools, and universities be well equipped to bridge the communication gaps between the hearing/speaking majority and the deaf/mute community.

# Objectives

--To build a Deep Learning model for the purpose of identifying and classifying English alphabets in the Indian Sign Language.

--To compare various optimizers to achieve better results.

# Dataset

--The dataset is directly downloaded from kaggle

--Ensure to download the Json file from the kaggle account that you posses.

--The dataset has 400 images each for the 26 alhabets.
